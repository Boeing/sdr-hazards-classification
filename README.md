## Service Difficult Report (SDR) hazards classification package
:rocket: This is the source code for the SDR Classifier package that classifies potential aviation safety hazards from textual data.  The work is a collaboration between FAA and Boeing data scientist teams

**Version 0.1.0 out now!**

## Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use venv, virtualenv or conda python environments. Read more about creating virtual environments via venv
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments

## Build and pip install the whl file locally
Run the command in the root folder to create the whl file in the _dist_ folder
```
git clone https://github.com/Boeing/sdr-hazards-classification
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install ./distr/sdr_hazards_classification-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Install sdr_hazards_classification from Pypi with pip
```
pip install sdr_hazards_classification
```

## Example
:airplane: Follow the code snippet below to test and call the prediction method from the Depressurization model

```
from sdr_hazards_classification import sdr_api
import pandas as pd

my_model = sdr_api.SdrInferenceAPI()

#test the prediction method
my_model.test_sdr_depressurization_predictions()

event_text = "Lost cabin pressurization at flight level 30000, cabin altitude warning horn sounded at 10000 feet. Unabel to control cabin pressure with outflow valve closed"
pred, probs = my_model.get_predictions([event_text])

df = pd.read_csv('./src/sdr_classifier/data/SDR_Example.csv')
records = df["Text"]
#pass in a record list for prediction
pred, probs = my_model.get_predictions(records)

df['Prediction'] = pred
df['Prob'] = probs

print(df.head(2))

print("Done")
```
